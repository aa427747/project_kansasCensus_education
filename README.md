# project_kansasCensus_education
KU Bootcamp projects 1 and 3

### Overview
The goal of the project was to see if there is a positive correlation between higher earnings and higher levels of education.  The project broke these down by gender and race.  Using pandas and the matplotlib libraries, manipulated the data and graphed to determine if there was correlation.  Created a regression model to predict the median income based on population using a single year.

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.  

### Prerequisites

The following requirements were used in the running of the app.  Also needed to run the app.py in Git Bash or Command vs the terminal in the environment that I was running in.  Provided below is the Python version we created the app in .  The website is built using Bootstrap in the recent version and was intially created through Bootstrapmade.  We are using mySQL and csv files to store all the data for visualization. 
You will need to supply your own mySQL database.  There may be some visualizations that don't work if you don't have the database, but those pulling from the .csv file will.

### Installing

To run the code, you will download the various files and run the app.py to get the Flask app running.  We ran it in terminal using Visual Studio code without any issues.  Once that is up and running, then go to your local host and the template and .js code should be working from the template and js folders.  In this program we are using mSQL dB, so you want to make sure that is available on your machine.

The key programs for running the application are:
* app.py


The remaining files are support to the creation of the model and the application.

### Built With

* Python [3.7.1]
* Jupyter [5.7.4]
* Other libraries located in the app.py
